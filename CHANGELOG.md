## [0.2.4] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- Windows CI green again — `BashTool` no longer hardcodes `/bin/sh` (which doesn't exist on Windows). Branches on `RuntimeInformation`: `pwsh -EncodedCommand <utf16-base64>` on Windows, `/bin/sh -c` on Unix. CI on `main` had been red since `d822355` (the "use /bin/sh universally" commit) — broken-window normalisation, now reset.
- `ConfigTests.loadProfile returns Some content` failed on Windows because `Environment.SpecialFolder.UserProfile` reads `USERPROFILE`, not `HOME`. Tests now set both env vars for platform-agnostic isolation.
- `BashToolTests.Bash reports non-zero exit code` switched from `"false"` (sh-only builtin) to `"exit 1"` (builtin in both sh and pwsh) — same intent, cross-shell.

### Refactor
- Slash-command list unified into `Fugue.Cli.SlashCommands` module — single source of truth for both inline autocomplete (`ReadLine.fs`) and `/help` rendering (`Repl.fs`). Two parallel hand-maintained lists had drifted three times in a week (latest: v0.2.3); root-cause fix. `/help` now also surfaces 5 entries that previously appeared only in inline suggestions: `/quit`, `/diff --staged`, `/doctor`, `/model set`, `/model suggest`. Net diff: -64 LOC across `ReadLine.fs` + `Repl.fs`. (#902)

[0.2.4]: https://github.com/korat-ai/fugue/releases/tag/v0.2.4

## [0.2.3] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- Inline slash-command suggestions reappear on bare `/` again (regression from v0.2.2 — was gated to ≥2 chars to avoid terminal overflow; the `truncate 8` cap already prevents that).
- Slash-suggestion list expanded from 13 to 70+ entries — `/m*`, `/scaffold *`, `/check *`, `/derive *`, `/refactor *`, `/migrate *`, `/translate *`, etc. were missing entirely. Two parallel lists (`ReadLine.fs` vs `Repl.fs helpItems`) had drifted apart.
- Removed stray `[/]` (Spectre markup) embedded inside a raw ANSI escape sequence in slash overflow hint.

[0.2.3]: https://github.com/korat-ai/fugue/releases/tag/v0.2.3

## [0.2.2] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- NuGet publishing — replaced manual `curl` OIDC fetch + raw JWT-as-api-key with official `NuGet/login@v1` action. NuGet Trusted Publishing requires an explicit token-exchange step (GitHub OIDC → NuGet temporary API key); we were skipping it, getting consistent 403 Forbidden. v0.2.0 and v0.2.1 NuGet pushes failed for this reason; v0.2.2 succeeds.

[0.2.2]: https://github.com/korat-ai/fugue/releases/tag/v0.2.2

## [0.2.1] — 2026-05-01

### Fixed
- `/model` picker crashed on render with `InvalidOperationException: Could not find color or style 's\'`. Spectre.Console markup escapes literal brackets as `[[` / `]]`, not `\[` / `\]` — the picker used the wrong escape, broke on every redraw.

[0.2.1]: https://github.com/korat-ai/fugue/releases/tag/v0.2.1

## [0.2.0] — 2026-05-01

### Added
- `/model` interactive picker — arrow-key navigation (↑/↓), Enter to select, Esc to cancel, digits 1-9 for quick-pick (#898)
- `/model set <name>` — runtime model switching with agent rebuild
- `Fugue.Agent.ModelDiscovery` — per-provider model listing (OpenAI/LM Studio `/v1/models`, Ollama `/api/tags`, Anthropic hardcoded). HTTP timeout 1.5s, AOT-safe via `JsonNode.Parse`
- `--help` flag — shows usage and exits cleanly without requiring config
- `/engineering-fsharp-developer` agent role with AOT hard rules and known traps reference
- CI: `verify-brew` job — smoke-tests `brew install fugue && fugue --version && fugue --help` after each release

### Changed
- Banner: `♩ Fugue` → `♩♪♫ Fugue` (rhythmic note sequence)
- Turn numbers `[N]` now follow message alignment — right-aligned messages show `[N]` at end of bubble
- Slash command suggestions only appear at ≥2 char prefix (bare `/` no longer overflows terminal)

### Fixed
- AOT crash on startup: `Render.gradientMarkup` and ~30 other `sprintf` call sites replaced with F# string interpolation `$"..."` — `PrintfImpl.MakeGenericMethod` is not AOT-compatible
- NuGet Trusted Publishing — explicit OIDC token retrieval via GitHub Actions ID token endpoint
- macOS release: `sha256sum` not available → portable fallback to `shasum -a 256`
- Release pipeline: force-publish via `gh release edit --draft=false` after creation (guards against retag draft regression)

### Documentation
- CLAUDE.md: hard rule "new slash commands prompt-first, code-last"
- CLAUDE.md: AOT smoke-test rule (`dotnet publish -r osx-arm64` and run native binary every 10 commits — `dotnet build` runs JIT and misses AOT failures)
- CLAUDE.md: semver release policy (features → minor, fixes → patch, no retags)

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/korat-ai/fugue/releases/tag/v0.2.0

- Approval modes: Plan / Default / Auto-Edit / YOLO (Shift+Tab)
- Status bar with streaming indicator, elapsed time, token/s estimate
